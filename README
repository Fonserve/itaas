# ITaaS Platform

The ITaaS Platform is a modular, scalable, and robust IT-as-a-Service application built using Django. The platform streamlines IT service management by offering subscription-based service contracts, one-time service orders, and add-on offerings—all in one integrated solution.

---

## Overview

The ITaaS Platform is designed to simplify IT service management for both service providers and customers. By leveraging Django, Django REST Framework, and Django Channels, the application ensures a seamless experience with powerful features such as real-time messaging, automated billing, dynamic scheduling, and geolocation-based service offerings.

## Project Goals & Ambitions

- **Empowering IT Service Providers:**
  Provide a comprehensive solution to manage IT service contracts, billing, scheduling, and customer communications, all within a single platform.

- **Modular & Scalable Architecture:**
  The application is divided into discrete Django apps (accounts, subscriptions, services, billing, messaging, dashboard), each handling a specific domain. This ensures a clean separation of concerns and allows for easy scalability and maintenance.

- **Community-Driven Development:**
  By following best practices in code organization, documentation, and testability, we aim to contribute a robust and extensible framework to the open-source community. We welcome contributions, feedback, and collaborative development.

- **User-Centric Experience:**
  Deliver an intuitive and responsive interface for customers and service technicians, enhanced with real-time communication and automated notifications.

## Key Features

- **Customer Portal:**
  Manage subscriptions, view billing history, schedule services, and track service performance.

- **Admin & Operator Dashboard:**
  A comprehensive interface for administrators to manage customers, orders, subscriptions, and financial metrics.

- **Real-Time Messaging:**
  Integrated messaging system powered by Django Channels, enabling live communication between customers and technicians.

- **Subscription & Billing Management:**
  Support for recurring subscription tiers, one-time service orders, and automated billing via integration with Stripe and PayPal.

- **Geolocation-Based Service Offers:**
  Tailor service offerings based on the user's location to provide localized support.

- **Extensible API:**
  Built using Django REST Framework (DRF) to expose secure, well-documented API endpoints for internal and external integrations.

## Application Structure

The project is divided into the following modular Django apps:

- **accounts:**
  Handles user registration, authentication (including multi-factor authentication), and profile management.

- **subscriptions:**
  Manages subscription tiers, service contracts, and SLA tracking.

- **services:**
  Manages one-time and recurring service orders, including scheduling and geolocation-based offers.

- **billing:**
  Handles invoice generation, payment history, and integration with payment gateways.

- **messaging:**
  Provides real-time messaging functionality using Django Channels to enable communication between customers and technicians.

- **dashboard:**
  Delivers custom dashboards for both customers and administrators, integrating data from various modules for a comprehensive overview.
